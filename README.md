# wat dis

my super simple personal notes collection.

Powered by GitHub Pages (created following [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)). This repo is cloned under a sub-directory in my [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/), so I can compose content using Obsidian, and publish it by committing and pushing to GitHub.
